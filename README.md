# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

## New Features (competition between 2 players)
* Another snake and another food are added to the game
* One snake is controlled by the arrow, the other is controlled by w(up), a(left), s(down), and d(right)
* Once one of the snakes has eaten the food, both food would be re-generated and game winner would be the player with higher score

## RUBRIC
### LOOPS, FUNCTIONS, I/O
* Allow user to enter player name at the beginning of the game
* The players' names and scores are displayed on top of the game window and the winner is shown after the termination of the game

### OOP
* Public / private functions needed are added accordingly (e.g. private variable `snake_name` and public function `GetName()` are added into class `Snake`
* Both snakes are initialized and implemented

### MEMORY MANAGEMENT
* Both snakes are passed by references in `HandleInput()` and `ChangeDirection()` in class `Controller`

### CONCURRENCY
* A lock is used to handle the input from the user in `Controller::HandleInput()`

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
